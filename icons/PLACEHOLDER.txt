⚠️ PLACEHOLDER ICONS

The icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) need to be created before loading the extension.

For now, you can:
1. Use the Python script create-icons.py to generate basic icons
2. Download icon templates online
3. Create them manually using design tools

The extension will still work without icons, but Chrome will show warnings.
